# =============================================================================
# Agent Behavior Preferences — Blog Automation Project
# =============================================================================
# These settings govern how the agent behaves within this workspace.
# NOT for secrets — use .env for API keys and credentials.
# =============================================================================

# --- Antigravity / Agent Runtime Settings ---
agent:
  # Controls whether terminal commands auto-execute or require user review.
  # "request_review" is recommended until the project is mature and trusted.
  terminal_command_execution: request_review

  # Controls when the agent generates Artifacts (plans, screenshots, task lists).
  # "agent_decides" lets the agent produce artifacts freely; user reviews before
  # any external action (deploy, push, publish).
  artifact_review_policy: agent_decides

  # Controls whether JavaScript runs automatically in the agent browser.
  # "request_review" prevents injected or unexpected JS from executing silently.
  javascript_execution_in_browser: request_review

  # Whether the agent should maintain and respect a browser allowlist.
  # Allowlist lives at: ~/.gemini/antigravity/browserAllowlist.txt
  enforce_browser_allowlist: true

# --- Workspace Security ---
security:
  # All file operations (create, modify, delete) must stay within workspace root.
  workspace_jail: true

  # Files outside .tmp/ require explicit user confirmation before deletion.
  delete_requires_confirmation_outside_tmp: true

  # Never use force flags (-f, --force) on delete operations unless user says so.
  allow_force_delete: false

  # Never log or echo secrets (API keys, tokens) to stdout or artifacts.
  mask_secrets_in_output: true

# --- Execution Layer (Layer 3) ---
execution:
  # Base directory for shared Python scripts.
  scripts_dir: execution/

  # Base directory for intermediate processing files.
  tmp_dir: .tmp/

  # Path to the .env file (relative to workspace root).
  env_file: .env

  # Default Python interpreter to use for execution scripts.
  python_interpreter: python

  # Whether to auto-install requirements when a script fails with ImportError.
  # Set to false to avoid silent environment changes.
  auto_install_requirements: false

# --- Skills Layer (Layer 1) ---
skills:
  # Base directory for workspace-scoped skills.
  workspace_skills_dir: .agent/skills/

  # Whether skills can be overwritten without user confirmation.
  # false = always ask before modifying an existing skill.
  allow_skill_overwrite_without_confirmation: false

  # Whether the agent should update skill references/ when it learns something new.
  # true = self-annealing is enabled (recommended).
  self_anneal_skills: true

# --- Artifacts ---
artifacts:
  # Preferred artifact types for communicating completed work to the user.
  preferred_types:
    - task_list
    - implementation_plan
    - screenshot
    - diff_summary

  # Whether to always include a diff summary when modifying existing files.
  always_diff_on_modify: true

# --- Logging ---
logging:
  # Logging verbosity: DEBUG | INFO | WARNING | ERROR
  level: INFO

  # Whether to write logs to a file in .tmp/ for debugging.
  write_to_file: false
  log_file: .tmp/agent.log
