# Knowledge Files

Place the 5 optimization knowledge files in this directory:

- `BLOG_OPTIMIZATION_EXECUTION_STANDARDS_v1_1.md`
- `LLM_CITATION_OPTIMIZATION_ADDENDUM_v1_0.md`
- `BING_OPTIMIZATION_ADDENDUM.md`
- `CREDENTIALS_OFFICIAL_FORMAT.md`
- `RAMADAN_OPTIMIZATION_ADDENDUM_v1_1.md`

These are loaded at runtime by `execution/blog_analyst.py` and concatenated
into the Claude system prompt as the "brain" of the optimization system.
